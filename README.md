## General Info
How do you play a "game" that does not need a human opponent?

This is a number guesser where you are playing against a bot. The bot and you both guess an **integer** between 0 and 9, and the one that guesses closer to the given "secret number" wins the round. If the numbers between yours and the bot's are tied, however, you win the round. You can play this out as many rounds as you like!

## How to Run
1. Download this file and preferably put this folder in C:\Users\ **Computer Name** \.
2. Open the index.html.
3. Input your choice number. It should be an integer between 0 and 9. Any other inputs will produce a flag.
4. Click "Make a Choice" when you are ready. See the result.
5. Press "Next Round" to play another round.
6. Play it out as many as you like! The scores are tracked.

## Future Improvements
